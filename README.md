times with requests being spaced 10 seconds apart.

## Installation

gem 'site_response_times'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

Run `thor response_time:average` from the command line. 
Optionally, you can provide an alternative url to check: `thor response_time:average url`

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
